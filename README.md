- 👋 Hi, I’m @rbilsky
- 👀 I’m interested in being better at what I do, more React, learning Typescript, learning Python and dataish stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go through tutorials and Python through osmosis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting. I am curious about VTT modules.
- 📫 How to reach me? [Linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-bilsky/) I guess?
